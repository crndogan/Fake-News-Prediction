# Fake-News-Prediction
Fake vs. Real News Analysis

Project Overview

This project focuses on detecting fake vs. real news headlines using web scraping, natural language processing (NLP), and machine learning. The workflow is divided into three main parts:

Data Collection (Web Scraping) – Extracting news headlines from online sources.

Text Analysis (NLP) – Cleaning, preprocessing, and analyzing word usage in real and fake news.

Machine Learning – Building models to classify news as fake or real. 

Technical Stack

Web Scraping: BeautifulSoup, requests

NLP: NLTK, scikit-learn (text vectorization, stopwords, lemmatization)

Machine Learning: Logistic Regression, Random Forest, SVM

Visualization: Matplotlib, WordCloud

Results

Identified key linguistic differences between fake and real news.

Machine learning models trained to classify news with measurable accuracy.

Demonstrated how unstructured text can be transformed into structured features for predictive modeling.
